## Introduction to cloud computing
###### Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform, with a large set os services to help build solutions to computing problems.
###### Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. The most common serivces are:
* compute power
* storage service

### The shared responsibility model
###### The shared responsibility model is a concept apllied on cloud platforms that shares the tasks about maintaining the hardware, the operation system, security, and even softawares in the cloud.
###### Some responsibilites are always with the cloud provider, such as the physical security, power, cooling and network connectivity. In the other hand, some are always with the consumer, as the data that will be persisted inside a storage service. And some of them depends of the service type.
###### The most commom cloud service types are:
* (Iaas) Infrastructure as a service
* (Paas) Platform as a service
* (SaaS) Software as a service

### Cloud models
* **Private cloud** is a kind of evolution of a corporative datacenter. It is used by a single company as consumer, and may be very expansive. It is hosted in a dedicated datacenter.  
* **Public cloud** is built, controlled and maintained by a cloud provider. Anyone that buy a resource can use a public cloud.
* **Hybrid cloud** is a cloud that uses a public and private cloud in a inter-connected environment.
* **Multi-cloud** is a scenario that the consumer uses different cloud services from different cloud providers.

###### **Azure Arc** is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment.
